# Babycino Compiler Project

The Babycino Compiler project successfully extends a simple Java compiler, "babycino," integrating new Java language features with precision. This project involved enhancing the compiler by implementing specific syntactic and semantic elements and validating these modifications through comprehensive test-driven development.

## Features

- **Implemented Features:** All planned features based on the Project criteria have been successfully integrated into the compiler, enhancing its functionality and compatibility with a subset of Java similar to MiniJava.
- **Comprehensive Test Cases:** A robust suite of test cases has been developed and applied, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the compiler with the new features.
- **Project Evaluation:** The compiler has been rigorously assessed, demonstrating its functionality and correctness with the implemented features.

## Getting Started

Review the completed project:

1. Clone the repository to explore the enhanced Babycino Compiler codebase.
2. Examine the implemented features and corresponding test cases documented within the project.

## Contributing

While the main project goals have been achieved, contributions that further refine the compiler or expand its capabilities are welcome. To contribute, please fork the repository, make your enhancements, and submit a pull request.
